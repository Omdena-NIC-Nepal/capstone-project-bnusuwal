Forest Fire Prediction and Impact Assessment System for Nepal

🌍 Project Overview

This project develops an end-to-end data analysis system that monitors, analyzes, and predicts forest fire occurrences and their impacts in Nepal, with a focus on vulnerable regions. It is developed as part of the Omdena-NIC Nepal Classroom Group B Capstone Project, which equips participants with foundational and advanced skills in AI and data science to address this critical climate-related challenge.

🎯 Project Goals

-Data Collection: Gather relevant forest fire and climate data from various sources specific to Nepal.
-Data Analysis: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand forest fire patterns and risk factors.
-Predictive Modeling: Build machine learning models to predict forest fire occurrences.
-Visualization: Create interactive dashboards to visualize fire risk zones and model predictions.

👥 Target Audience
Recent data science graduates applying their skills to real-world climate problems.

Government agencies, NGOs, and research institutions involved in climate change mitigation and adaptation in Nepal.
