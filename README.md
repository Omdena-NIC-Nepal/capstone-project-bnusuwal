# Forest Fire Prediction and Impact Assessment System for Nepal

### 🌍 Project Overview

## This project is an end-to-end data analysis and AI-based prediction system for forest fire occurrences in Nepal, with a special focus on vulnerable regions.

### 🎯 Project Goals

- **Data Collection**: Gather relevant forest fire and climate datasets from diverse Nepali sources.
- **Data Analysis**: Perform exploratory and statistical analysis to understand fire patterns and climate correlations.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop machine learning models to predict forest fire occurrences and risk scores.
- **Visualization**: Design interactive dashboards for exploring fire risk zones and model outputs.
